# Commit After Each Fix / Prompt

**Always commit** at the end of every response where you:

- Apply a fix (bug, error, regression)
- Implement a feature or change requested in the user's prompt
- Modify project files (code, config, docs)

## What to do

1. After making edits, run `git status` and `git add` the changed files.
2. Create a **single commit** with a clear, concise message (e.g. `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`).
3. Do **not** push unless the user asks; just commit locally.

## Commit message format

- `fix: ...` for bugfixes
- `feat: ...` for new features
- `docs: ...` for documentation-only changes
- `chore: ...` for tooling, config, or minor updates

Example: `fix(cex): fallback fetch directo desde navegador si /api/cex 403`
